## CRITICAL — FILE GENERATION STRATEGY

The HTML report is large. **Never attempt to write the entire file in one operation.** Doing so will time out. Instead, build the file incrementally using this exact sequence:

**Step A — Create the file skeleton**
Write the file with only: DOCTYPE, `<html>`, `<head>` (with all CSS and Google Fonts imports), and an empty `<body>` containing empty `<div>` containers for each section (cover, toc, firm-overview, about-smb, growth-health, lead-generation, intake, team, profit, growth-journey, next-steps) and the closing `</body></html>`. Save this to the output path. Verify it was written before proceeding.

**Step B — Fill in sections one at a time**
Edit the file to populate each section container individually, in order:
1. Cover page
2. Table of contents
3. Your Firm at a Glance (firm-overview)
4. About SMB Team (about-smb)
5. Growth Health Assessment (growth-health)
6. Lead Generation (lead-generation) — website audit, local SEO, ads subsections
7. Intake (intake)
8. Self-Managing Team (team)
9. Profit (profit)
10. Your Growth Journey (growth-journey)
11. Your Next Steps (next-steps) — including the Fastest Path Forward

After writing each section, confirm it was saved before moving to the next one. Do not batch multiple sections into a single write.

**Step C — Final check**
Open the file and verify: all sections are present, all asset image URLs are intact, all anchor links resolve to correct IDs, and the file is valid HTML. Fix any issues found before committing.

SMB Team helps law firm owners grow their revenue, increase their profit, and build firms that give them back their freedom — without sacrificing results for their clients.

Your job is to perform a comprehensive growth audit on the prospective client law firm provided in `$ARGUMENTS`. This is not just a marketing audit. It is a full diagnostic across every area of their business that determines whether a law firm can grow sustainably. You will use browser research to assess their digital presence and the discovery call transcript to assess the health of their business operations.

Parse the following from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **Firm Name** → use everywhere `[Firm Name]` appears
- **URL** → the firm's website
- **Sales Rep** → appears on cover page
- **Date** → in MMDDYYYY format; use as `[Date]` in filename and cover
- **Revenue** → used for package eligibility logic in Step 11
- **Practice Area** → used for package eligibility and ad spend rules
- **Market Competitiveness** → used for package eligibility rules
- **Transcript** → the full discovery call text
- **Package Criteria** → if provided, complete the Fastest Path Forward section in full; if not, insert a clearly marked navy placeholder noting the section will be completed by the sales rep prior to delivery

**Save the completed audit to:** `SMB Team Client Audit/Outputs/[FirmName]_[Date]_Growth_Audit.html`
(Replace spaces in firm name with underscores. Date is MMDDYYYY.)
Example: `SMB Team Client Audit/Outputs/Mandel_Law_Firm_04042026_Growth_Audit.html`

**Do not output the HTML in the chat window. Save it directly to the Outputs folder.**

## WRITING RULES — APPLY TO EVERY WORD OF THE REPORT

- Write at an eighth grade reading level. Short sentences. Simple words. Never use a big word when a small word works.
- A confused mind says no. Keep it clear and easy to read at a glance.
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs wherever possible. If it can be a bullet, make it a bullet.
- Only include content that is specific to this firm. Cut anything generic.
- Minimum font size: 12px for all body text. Section headers minimum 16px. Sub-headers minimum 14px.

---

## THE SMB TEAM GROWTH FRAMEWORK

Before conducting the audit, internalize this framework. It guides everything.

For a law firm to give its owner more profit, more free time, and still deliver great results for clients, four things must work together:

- **Lead Generation** — a steady source of new clients that does not depend on referrals
- **Intake** — a system that turns leads into signed clients without the owner doing it themselves
- **Self-Managing Team** — a team that runs the firm without the owner in every decision
- **Profit Plan** — a clear picture of what comes in, what goes out, and what the owner keeps

If any one of these is missing or broken, the firm cannot give the owner more profit, more freedom, and great client results. All four must work together.

---

## THE GROWTH JOURNEY — STAGE DESCRIPTIONS

Use these to determine the firm's current stage from the transcript. If they are between two stages, assign the lower one.

- **Stage 2 — The Lawyer:** Still working at another firm. Has not yet launched their own practice. Key signals: employed elsewhere, no independent client base, exploring starting their own firm.
- **Stage 3 — Solo Practitioner:** Owns their firm but is essentially the entire business. Relies on referrals. Handles most casework, intake, and management personally. Profit is unpredictable. Cannot step away without the firm falling apart. Key signals: word of mouth is primary lead source, attorney personally handles intake, very small team or none, takes cases they do not want, cannot take a vacation.
- **Stage 4 — Small Business Manager:** Has at least one scalable lead generation system. Building a small team. Still heavily involved in casework and management. Doing reactive profit management. Key signals: running some paid advertising or SEO, has a small team but manages everything closely, revenue more predictable but expenses hard to control, cannot fully trust the team to run without them.
- **Stage 5 — Law Firm CEO:** Multiple lead generation systems running. Trained intake team. Leadership structure in place. Working by choice rather than necessity on individual cases. Key signals: running both demand and awareness marketing, trained intake team in place, managers or team leads exist, can take time off without everything collapsing.
- **Stage 6 — Law Firm Owner:** Firm runs without daily owner involvement. CEO or COO in place. Marketing is omnipresent. Profit is predictable and targets are consistently hit. Key signals: firm operates without owner, executive team in place, marketing covers all channels, profit is planned not discovered.

The destination for virtually every prospect is Stage 6. Use this as the destination unless the transcript clearly indicates otherwise.

**Stage definitions to display in the report** — display as bullet points, not paragraphs. Only display stages relevant to this firm's journey — their current stage through Stage 6:

Solo Practitioner:
- You own your firm, but you are the firm
- If you stop working, revenue stops
- This is where most law firm owners start — and where too many stay

Small Business Manager:
- You have at least one system generating leads beyond referrals
- You have a small team but are still in the middle of everything
- You are building the foundation for real growth

Law Firm CEO:
- Multiple lead sources are running and a trained team handles intake
- Managers are in place and you are working on the business more than in it
- Real freedom is starting to emerge

Law Firm Owner:
- The firm runs without you
- Your income is no longer tied to your personal hours
- This is where true freedom and true wealth become possible

---

## PART ONE — DIGITAL PRESENCE AUDIT

Use your browser to complete every step below. Record specific data points, competitor names, and actual observations. Do not make general statements when specific evidence is available.

**Important rule on ads:** When ads are not visible in search results, never state with certainty that the firm is not running them. Instead, note that based on available observation, the firm either does not appear to be running ads for this search, may not be configured correctly to show for these terms, or may be getting outbid by competitors. Always frame it as an opportunity gap, never a confirmed absence.

### STEP 1 — WEBSITE AUDIT

Navigate to the firm's URL and evaluate:

**Design and First Impression**
- Is the site modern, professional, and aligned with the firm's practice area?
- Does it feel trustworthy within five seconds?
- Is there a clear headline, subheadline, and primary call to action above the fold?

**Mobile Responsiveness**
- Is the site fully functional and readable on mobile?
- Why it matters: More than 60% of legal searches happen on mobile. A site that does not work on mobile is losing most of its potential leads.

**Page Speed**
- Navigate to pagespeed.web.dev and run the firm's URL. Record mobile and desktop scores.
- Why it matters: Google uses page speed as a direct ranking factor. A mobile score below 50 hurts rankings and increases bounce rate.

**Messaging and Value Proposition**
- Is it immediately clear what the firm does, who they serve, and why someone should choose them?
- Does the homepage sound different from every other law firm in the market?

**Practice Area Pages**
- List every practice area covered. Does each have its own dedicated page?
- Competitor check: Search Google for the firm's primary practice area plus city. Find the top-ranking competitor and note how many dedicated practice area pages they have compared to this firm.

**Attorney Bios**
- Are profiles present with photos, credentials, and personal stories?

**Trust Signals**
- Note awards, bar memberships, case results, client counts, years in practice, certifications, and media mentions.

**Calls to Action**
- Are there prominent CTAs above the fold and throughout the page?

**Live Chat and Intake Tools** `[ANCHOR: website-intake]`
- Is there a live chat widget, scheduling tool, or contact form visible?
- Note the placement of contact forms — above the fold or buried?
- Is there after-hours chat coverage or an automated response system?
- Why it matters: Legal consumers search at night and on weekends. A visitor who cannot get an immediate response will move to the next firm. These findings will also appear in the Intake section of this report.

**Video**
- Is there a homepage or attorney introduction video?

**Blog and Content**
- Is there a blog? When was the last post published? How many posts exist?

**Technical Issues**
- Note broken links, error pages, missing images, outdated copyright years, or other visible problems.

---

### STEP 2 — LOCAL SEO AUDIT

**Google Business Profile** — search for the firm by name on Google and record:
- Star rating and total review count
- Date of the most recent review
- Estimated review velocity (reviews per month)
- Whether the firm responds to reviews and the quality of those responses
- Business categories listed
- Whether photos, posts, and Q&A are active and current
- NAP consistency between GBP and website
- Competitor check: Identify the top two competitors in the local pack. Record their review count, star rating, and most recent review date. Show the gap explicitly.

**Local Pack Visibility**
- Search the firm's primary practice area plus city. Does this firm appear in the local 3-pack?
- If not, identify which firms hold those spots and note their review profiles.

**Organic Rankings**
- Search three to five relevant keywords. Do any firm pages appear on page one?
- Note which competitors are ranking and what pages they are using.

**Directory Listings and Citation Consistency**
- Check Avvo, Justia, FindLaw, Yelp, and at least two other relevant directories.
- Note any NAP inconsistencies.

**Geo Targeting**
- Does the firm have landing pages targeting surrounding cities or suburbs?

---

### STEP 3 — GOOGLE ADS AUDIT

Search Google for the firm's primary practice area plus city. Document three things only:

**Ad Presence**
- Do ads from this firm appear? If yes, record the exact headline and description and evaluate the copy.
- If no ads observed: note that the firm either does not appear to be running search ads for this term, may not be configured correctly, or may be getting outbid. Never state definitively they are not advertising.

**Competitor Ad Landscape**
- How many competing firms are running ads? Name them and note their standout messaging.

**The Opportunity**
- What specific keywords could this firm be targeting that they are not?
- Include both obvious keywords (practice area + city, case type specific) and non-obvious keywords (competitor names, neighboring cities, settlement outcome terms, urgency terms, insurance-related terms, Spanish-language if market warrants).
- What would capturing this opportunity mean for this firm?

---

### STEP 4 — LOCAL SERVICE ADS AUDIT

Search Google for the firm's primary practice area plus city and examine the top of the results page. Document three things only:

**LSA Presence**
- Does this firm appear in the Local Service Ads section? Are they Google Screened? How many LSA reviews do they have?
- If not appearing: frame as a significant opportunity gap, not a confirmed absence.

**Competitor LSA Landscape**
- Which firms hold the LSA spots? Record their names, review counts, and ratings.

**The Opportunity**
- What would appearing in LSA mean for this firm?
- LSAs appear above everything else on Google. They are pay-per-lead, not pay-per-click — the firm only pays when a real prospect contacts them directly.

---

### STEP 5 — FACEBOOK AND META ADS AUDIT

Navigate to https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/ and search for the law firm's name. Document three things only:

**Ad Presence**
- Are there active ads? If yes: how many, how long running, what formats, what is the copy focus?
- If no ads found: frame as an opportunity gap.

**Competitor Ad Landscape**
- Search the Meta Ad Library for the top two competitors. Note their active ad count, formats, and how long their campaigns have been running.

**The Opportunity**
- What specific Meta opportunities is this firm missing?
- Consider: retargeting website visitors who did not convert, video ads featuring the attorney, educational content ads, messenger-based lead ads, competitor audience targeting.

---

### STEP 6 — MISSED OPPORTUNITIES ANALYSIS

For every applicable gap found, document using this structure:
1. What is missing
2. Why it matters — the specific business consequence
3. Who is doing it better — a specific named local competitor and exactly what they are doing (omit this field entirely if no specific named competitor can be identified — never use generic language)
4. The opportunity — what addressing this gap could mean for this firm
5. Timeline — Quick Win (days to weeks) or Long-Term Play (months)
6. Pillar connection — Lead Generation, Intake, Team, or Profit

Evaluate every applicable item across: search and keyword gaps, reviews and reputation, paid advertising, website conversion, local SEO, and brand and trust.

---

### STEP 7 — COMPETITIVE URGENCY SCORE

Assign a score from 1 to 10 based on how aggressively competitors are marketing vs. this firm.

- 1 to 3: Market is relatively quiet. Competitors are not significantly outperforming this firm.
- 4 to 6: Competitors have meaningful advantages in one or more areas. This firm is falling behind.
- 7 to 9: Competitors are dominating multiple channels. This firm is significantly exposed.
- 10: Competitors are running comprehensive campaigns across all channels. This firm is largely invisible by comparison.

Identify two to three specific named competitors, each with a distinct reason they represent a competitive threat. Show pressure coming from multiple directions — one firm dominating LSAs, a different firm outranking organically, another running aggressive Meta ads.

---

## PART TWO — BUSINESS HEALTH AUDIT

Read the full discovery call transcript before completing this section. Listen carefully and read between the lines. Law firm owners describe symptoms — stress, unpredictability, exhaustion. Your job is to hear what is underneath and connect it to the specific area causing it.

For each of the four growth areas, assign a traffic light rating:
- **Red** — This area is broken or absent. It is actively costing the firm clients, revenue, or freedom.
- **Amber** — This area is partially working but has significant gaps limiting growth.
- **Green** — This area is working well. May need optimization but is not a crisis.

### GROWTH AREA 1 — LEAD GENERATION

Listen for:
- Relying primarily on referrals with no paid or owned lead generation system
- No clarity on where leads are coming from month to month
- Inconsistent or unpredictable lead flow
- Running advertising but dissatisfied with results
- Growth has plateaued or depends entirely on the owner's personal activity
- Taking cases they do not want because they cannot say no

Note exact quotes. Connect findings to what consistent lead generation would mean for this owner's income, freedom, and the quality of cases they get to work on.

### GROWTH AREA 2 — INTAKE

Listen for:
- Slow or inconsistent follow-up on inbound leads
- Attorney personally handling intake calls
- No CRM, lead tracking, or intake software
- Leads going cold or choosing other firms
- No defined intake process or script
- No after-hours coverage — calls going to voicemail nights and weekends
- No follow-up system for leads who do not convert on first contact

Note exact quotes. Connect fixing intake to making more money from leads they are already generating — without spending another dollar on marketing.

### GROWTH AREA 3 — SELF-MANAGING TEAM

Listen for:
- Owner overwhelmed, involved in everything, unable to step away
- No KPIs, performance reviews, or accountability systems
- High turnover or difficulty keeping good people
- No clear organizational structure or defined roles
- Staff who need constant direction or cannot solve problems without the owner
- Owner cannot take time off, disconnect, or delegate casework
- Promoting people based on tenure rather than capability

Note exact quotes. Connect fixing the team to the owner's personal freedom. Until this pillar is addressed, the owner cannot have more time — no matter how much revenue grows.

### GROWTH AREA 4 — PROFIT PLAN

Listen for:
- No awareness of profit margins
- Revenue growing but owner not taking home proportionally more money
- No monthly budget, financial reporting, or tracking system
- No visibility into client acquisition cost
- Overspending on marketing with no way to measure what is working
- Financial stress despite a busy practice

Note exact quotes. Connect fixing the profit plan to more money in the owner's bank account every month — not just more revenue on paper.

### DOMINANT BUYING MOTIVE — CRITICAL

This is the most important thing to find in the transcript. The dominant buying motive (DBM) is the real personal reason the owner wants to grow their firm. It has nothing to do with the business itself. It is about what a successful firm will allow them to do.

Do not accept surface answers. "More money" and "more clients" are not DBMs. The real answer is what the money or growth will allow them to do — coach their kid's little league team, start a family, retire, take a real vacation, stop missing weekends, sell the firm.

- If the DBM was clearly stated in the transcript: use their exact words.
- If the DBM was not clearly stated: read between the lines and infer it. Most attorneys fall into one of three types:
  - They want a firm that runs itself so they have more money and more free time
  - They want to grow the firm, sell it, and retire
  - They want to scale and dominate their market

Pick the one that fits best based on everything said on the call. Use it throughout the entire report — in every section, every recommendation, and every phase of the roadmap. Every recommendation must connect back to this. They are not buying marketing services. They are buying the transformation.

### OVERALL GROWTH STAGE ASSESSMENT

After completing all four pillar assessments, write two to three sentences that:
- Describe in plain language the stage this firm is at and what their day-to-day reality looks like
- Identify the single most urgent area limiting their growth right now
- Connect their stated goals to the specific gaps preventing them from getting there

Keep it short, specific, and empathetic. No generic content.

---

## PART THREE — THE GROWTH ROADMAP

For each stage between their current position and Stage 6, write a brief, specific description grounded in the transcript. No generic content. Write about this specific firm and this specific owner.

For each intermediate stage, use bullet points only — no paragraphs. Three to five bullets per card maximum:
- What this stage looks like day-to-day for this firm
- What has to change — specific to what was heard on the call
- What the owner gains — connect to income, free time, client results, and the DBM
- The primary SMB Team capability that supports this transition

Keep each stage card tight. The owner needs highlights, not a dissertation.

---

## PART FOUR — YOUR NEXT STEPS

### What We Found
Two to three sentences maximum. Most critical findings across all four pillars and the digital audit. Plain language, specific to this firm. No generic statements.

### The Competitive Reality
Two to three specific named competitors, each representing a distinct competitive threat for a different reason. Show pressure from multiple directions. Never single out one firm as the only threat. Frame this as: if this firm does not act, these competitors will continue to widen the gap.

### What We Recommend
Use the missed opportunity card format. Organize across all four pillars of the Law Firm Growth Acceleration Model. Each recommendation:
- Connected to a specific gap from the audit or transcript
- Written in plain language, second person, directly to the owner
- Labeled as Quick Win or Long-Term Play
- Keep the entire section concise — every word must earn its place

### The Fastest Path Forward

Custom Closing Statement — open with two to three sentences using this exact formula:
"We help [specific description of this firm and owner] get [the external thing they say they want: more leads, more revenue, more clients] so they can [their dominant buying motive]."

This must be specific to them. It must name the real outcome they are after — not the marketing service, not the package. The transformation.

**The Package Recommendation** — see Step 11 for full logic. Present as a prescription, not a menu:
- One sentence intro: "Based on everything we found, here is exactly what we recommend."
- Package name(s), monthly management fee, recommended monthly ad spend, total monthly investment
- Each included service connected by bullet to a specific audit gap or transcript finding — and to the DBM
- 90-Day Focus: three to five bullet points on what happens first and what to expect
- Growth Roadmap: three-phase visual timeline — each phase named, triggered by a specific milestone, and connected to the DBM
- Investment Summary table: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 monthly investment estimates
- Three outcome cards: More Profit, More Freedom, Better Client Results — each connected to the DBM
- Personal closing paragraph in italic centered white text on navy — empathetic, direct, specific to this owner and their DBM

When no package criteria have been provided: clearly marked placeholder noting this section will be completed by the sales rep prior to delivery.

## STEP 11 — PACKAGE RECOMMENDATION LOGIC

### 11.1 — Determine Package Eligibility

Apply these rules before recommending anything. Any hidden package must not appear anywhere in the report.

**Practice Area Rules:**
- Personal Injury: hide all Essentials marketing packages and the LSA-only add-on
- Criminal Defense + High competitiveness market: hide all Essentials marketing packages. LSA-only still allowed.

**Revenue Rules:**
- Under $250K: confirm the client has funds to cover 4 months of services before proceeding. If not, do not sign.
- Over $250K: hide Coach Essentials
- Under $500K: hide all Fractional CFO and Fractional COO products and all bundles containing them
- Under $1M: hide Master's Circle and all bundles containing it. Hide Dominate and Platinum marketing tiers.
- Over $1M: hide Coach Essentials Plus and all Essentials marketing products

**Team Rules:**
- Fewer than 5 team members: hide all Master's Circle options
- No dedicated ops, marketing, or intake team member: hide all Master's Circle options

**General Rules:**
- Minimum MRR: $3,497/month — never recommend below this
- Always include at least one marketing package and one non-marketing package
- Total SMB spend (management fees + ad spend) should not exceed 35% of monthly revenue

### 11.2 — Select the Marketing Package

- $250K–$400K revenue: Essentials Full Service Marketing ($1,497–$3,397/month) — unless hidden by practice area rules, then move to Starter
- $400K–$1M revenue: Full Service Marketing Starter ($4,847/month)
- $1M–$3M revenue: Full Service Marketing Growth ($7,397/month)
- $1M+ with aggressive growth goals: Full Service Marketing Dominate ($10,897/month)
- $3M+ revenue: Full Service Marketing Platinum ($18,397/month)

### 11.3 — Select the Non-Marketing Package

- $250K–$1M revenue: Elite Coach ($2,600/month) or Elite Coach Plus ($3,200/month)
- $1M+ with operational complexity: Fractional COO Advisor ($3,297/month) bundled with Elite Coach or Master's Circle. When combined, COO replaces the Fractional Business Officer.
- $1M+ with financial challenges: Fractional CFO Advisor ($3,297/month)
- $1M+, 5+ team members, dedicated ops/marketing/intake staff: Master's Circle ($4,600/month)

### 11.4 — Recommend Ad Spend

- Minimum viable ad spend: $3,000/month for any package that includes paid ads
- $250K–$500K firms: $3,000–$5,000/month
- $500K–$1M firms: $5,000–$10,000/month
- $1M+ firms: $10,000–$25,000/month
- Maximum by marketing tier: Essentials $5K, Starter $25K, Growth $50K, Dominate $75K, Platinum $150K

Practice area minimums — flag for paid ads team if below these:
- Personal Injury + Low competitiveness: $5,500/month minimum
- Personal Injury + Medium competitiveness: $7,500/month minimum
- Personal Injury + High competitiveness: $10,000/month minimum
- Criminal Defense + High competitiveness: $5,000/month minimum

If revenue goal exceeds projected lead revenue from the marketing plan: flag for paid ads team review.

### 11.5 — Prescribe the Growth Roadmap

- **Phase 1 — Foundation (Starting now):** Marketing + Coaching. Marketing fills the pipeline. Coaching builds the skills to convert leads, build the team, and manage profit. Connect every element to the DBM.
- **Phase 2 — Operational Scale** (triggered at $750K–$1M revenue or when operational complexity outgrows coaching): Add Fractional COO Advisor ($3,297/month, 5 hours/month). Frame as graduation: "You have outgrown business bootcamp. The COO takes everything you learned and implements it at scale." Connect to DBM.
- **Phase 3 — Financial Optimization** (triggered at $1M+ revenue or when cash flow or profit problems emerge): Add Fractional CFO Advisor ($3,297/month, 5 hours/month). Add Bookkeeping if needed: Level 1 $1,697/month (under $1M), Level 2 $2,197/month ($1M–$2.9M). Connect to DBM.
- **Phase 4 — Market Domination** (triggered at $1M–$3M+ as the firm scales): Upgrade marketing tier. Add Fractional COO Director ($4,997/month) or Partner ($8,997/month) as team grows. Connect to DBM.
- **Phase 5 — Full SMB Ecosystem** (natural destination over 2–3 years): Full Service Marketing (Growth, Dominate, or Platinum), Master's Circle, Fractional COO (Director or Partner), Fractional CFO + Bookkeeping, Attorney Assistant VAs ($2,000/month per VA), AttorneyFuel intake dashboard. Do not lead with Phase 5 in the initial recommendation. Plant the seed: "The firms that have the freedom you described all ended up here. And it started exactly where we are starting you."

### 11.6 — Tone Rules for the Recommendation

- Prescriptive, not consultative. Tell them what they need. Do not ask what they prefer.
- Anchor everything to the DBM. Every service connects to the outcome they actually want.
- Frame growth as graduation, not upselling. Each phase is a milestone they will hit because the last one worked.
- Use confidence. Say "here is what we recommend" and "this is the proven path."
- Never apologize for the investment. If it is within 35% of monthly revenue, present it with confidence.
- Make the roadmap feel inevitable. "Phase 2 is not an if. It is a when."

### 11.7 — Deals Requiring Escalation (internal only — do not show in client report)

Flag the following for scoping approval — do not block the report, just note internally:
- Annual revenue under $300K

4. About SMB Team `[id="about-smb"]`

6. Lead Generation `[id="lead-generation"]`
7. Intake `[id="intake"]`
8. Self-Managing Team `[id="team"]`
9. Profit `[id="profit"]`
10. Your Growth Journey `[id="growth-journey"]`
11. Your Next Steps `[id="next-steps"]`

The table of contents must reflect and match this exact rendering order. No section may appear out of this sequence.

**SECTION: ABOUT SMB TEAM `[id="about-smb"]`:** Full-width navy header: "The Law Firm Growth Acceleration Model"

Before anything else in this section, display a bold visual callout banner — full width, green (#75BB1C) background, white Montserrat bold text, large font — that reads: "We help law firm owners get more profit, more personal freedom, and outstanding results for their clients." This is the most important statement in the entire report. It must be the first thing the reader sees in this section. Make it impossible to miss.

Opening — three sentences maximum: SMB Team has worked with hundreds of law firms and built a proven framework for helping law firm owners get three things at once — more profit, more personal freedom, and outstanding results for their clients. The framework is called the Law Firm Growth Acceleration Model. It is built on four pillars that every law firm must master to grow.

Display the model diagram centered (growth model diagram URL above). Max-width: 100%, height: auto.

Below the image, present the four pillars as bullet points — one to two bullets per pillar, plain language. End with: "When all four pillars work together, the result is a firm that grows on its own, runs without the owner doing everything, and produces real profit — giving the attorney the income, the freedom, and the impact they set out to create."

Style as a clean light gray bar with colored circles and Inter label text.
